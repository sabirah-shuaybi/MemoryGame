# MemoryGame

This program creates a basic memory game which the player can interact with. To accomplish this task, the program 
contains three classes: __Concentration__, __CardCollection__ and __Card__.

The __Concentration__ class is responsible for positioning the Cheat and New Game buttons
and creating a collection of cards when the program starts. The class handles mouse events
from the user who is interacting with the game. It keeps track of the state of the game,
how many cards have been clicked on (0,1,2) and proceeds accordingly.
